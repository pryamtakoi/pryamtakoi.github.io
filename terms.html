                                    benefit to us from the visibility of the hyperlink compensates the absence of <span
                                            class="server-name"></span>; and (d) the link is in the context of general
                                    resource information.</p>

                                <p>These organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: (a) is not in any
                                    way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or approval of
                                    the linking party and its products or services; and (c) fits within the context of
                                    the linking partyвЂ™s site.</p>
